Jackie was ready for his trip to Tokoyo. He had his bags packed and everything. It was his first time traveling in a while as he wasn't able to do so because of COVID-19.
Finally, he would have the time, to relax from his long days at work at the CIA. A lovely family vacation with his beautiful wife, Laura, and his two children, Amy and Jackson. 
The whole family had been excited for the trip ever since the final plans had been declared. To Jackie's surprise, everyone was just as enthusiastic at one in the morning as they
left for the airport. The family's excitement died down once they reached the airport and realized how long of a line there was. The two kids fell asleep as Jackie and 
Laura patiently waited for their boarding time. Despite the initial crowd, their termnal was quiet and peaceful. Jackie, tired for the long trip ahead of him, began to drift off.
The peaceful rest he wished to have was quickly interrupted by the erupting sound of an explosion that echoed through the airport.
