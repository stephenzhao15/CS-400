Jackie was ready for his trip to Tokoyo. He had his bags packed and everything. It was his first time traveling in a while as he wasn't able to do so because of COVID-19.
Finally, he would have the time, to relax from his long days at work at the CIA. A lovely family vacation with his beautiful wife, Laura, and his two children, Amy and Jackson. 
The whole family had been excited for the trip ever since the final plans had been declared. To Jackie's surprise, everyone was just as enthusiastic at one in the morning as they
left for the airport. The family's excitement died down once they reached the airport and realized how long of a line there was. The two kids fell asleep as Jackie and 
Laura patiently waited for their boarding time. Despite the initial crowd, their termnal was quiet and peaceful. Jackie, tired for the long trip ahead of him, began to drift off.
The peaceful rest he wished to have was quickly interrupted by the erupting sound of an explosion that echoed through the airport.

Aaron Stephenson's paragraph:
The first thing he did was truned to look at his wife and kids to make sure they were alright. Security was dashing through the airport termials while on their radios trying to make sence of what just happened.
An anouncement from the intercom of the airport came overhead saying they were locking it down so no suspects could leave and no flights would be leaving or coming in anytime soon. 
Eveyone was still in shock and wondered what really happened and what caused the explosion?
